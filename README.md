# TransparencyWorld - Layer 2 Blockchain Donation Platform

TransparencyWorld is a decentralized application (DApp) designed as part of a project to demonstrate how blockchain technology can make donations transparent, auditable, and secure. This platform leverages Layer 2 Ethereum networks, NFT-based file storage, and smart contracts to create an end-to-end solution for managing and verifying donations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to:

- Enable donors to contribute funds transparently.
- Allow organizations to create and share verifiable donation posts with IPFS storage.
- Provide public profiles where anyone can verify donation activities.
- Showcase decentralized verification and record-keeping as a proof of concept.
